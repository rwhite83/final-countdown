# final-countdown
A node.js application where users can login, add tasks, and have them filtered by when they expire.  
The idea is that students can add tasks and their due dates, to prioritize what is coming up next, and have an overview of what is coming up afterwards.  
It can be used for any purpose beyond this as well of course, students and due dates is only the genesis of the idea.  
After term 2 I made a static html/css/js version where I had to manually change the titles and due dates.  
This is for other users to be able to do the same thing in a user friendly way
